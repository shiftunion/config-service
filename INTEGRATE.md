# Integrate learning with reflection

1. What surprised you?
2. What frustrated you?
3. How would you rate your planning efforts?
4. Did you experience any overwhelm?
5. How did you find not hand-writing code?
6. How will this experience influence you going forward?

Before the next time we meet, please post a link to your repo and your reflections to Discord.
