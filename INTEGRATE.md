# Integrate learning with reflection

## 1. What surprised you?
- I must admit, I had a lot of fun here.
- I felt years of frustration at my atrophying language skills, lift and dissipate, as we can focus on the core higher level concepts, which have always been more interesting to me.
    - how easy it was to drill down and use the agent to understand and modify code
- Surprised at just how far these tools have come, since I tried them 6 months ago
- Surprised at how easy it was to get something up and running, to iterate many times, and how the context could be switched between different coding assistance very easily (Codex, Chat-GPT, Cline, Co-pilot).

## 2. What frustrated you?
The Agents seems to be no concept of confidence scores. It always seems confident, even when it does things that are not right.

## 3. How would you rate your planning efforts?
My planning efforts were just okay. I love the prompting approach, and getting multiple agents to critique each other, highlight gaps and opportunities.
I feel like facilitated them well agentic brainstorming workshop!

## 4. Did you experience any overwhelm?
I got a little bit of overwhelm, when I fell into old habits of spending too long in front of the keyboard, but I know I shouldn’t take a break and get some perspective!
I don’t know, Python, which I think was an interesting aspect of this exercise for me, where I had to trust the agent, and focus on architectural and design fundamentals…

## 5. How did you find not hand-writing code?
Very easy for me, I don’t know Python, and I don’t code with much frequency these days. So I was happy to let the agent do it, and explain it. I found this quite liberating, as it removed my perfectionist OCD tendencies,

## 6. How will this experience influence you going forward?
- Game changer really got dial into where the agents are right now. I’ve got so many questions though.
- How does a scale too much bigger contexts? 
- How does this work/scale with large legacy code bases? 
  - Should we be creating more specific models for these cases? 
  - General vs. more language pacific models - when should we use one over the other?
