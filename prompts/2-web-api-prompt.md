# Prompt:

Create a comprehensive implementation plan for a REST Web API service using the following requirements.
- Strictly adhere to the specifications below. Do not introduce additional dependencies, frameworks, or tools without explicitly asking for approval first.
- Include in your plan:
- All external dependencies with their exact versions.
- Recommended file/folder structure.
- Appropriate architectural patterns.
- SQL schema definitions and migration system approach.
- Testing approach (unit + integration as specified).
- Developer experience tooling (e.g., Makefile, uv usage).
- If any detail is unclear or missing, ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions.

Tech Stack (versions must be exact)
- Python 3.13.5
- FastAPI 0.116.1
- Pydantic 2.11.7 (for validation and service config)
- pytest 8.4.1
- httpx 0.28.1 (for HTTP testing)
- PostgreSQL v16
- psycopg2 2.9.10

Data Models

Applications (applications table)
- id: string/ULID (primary key)
- name: string(256), unique
- comments: string(1024)

Configurations (configurations table)
- id: string/ULID (primary key)
- application_id: string/ULID (foreign key)
- name: string(256), unique per application
- comments: string(1024)
- config: JSONB (dictionary with name/value pairs)

API Endpoints (prefix: /api/v1)

Applications
- POST /applications
- PUT /applications/{id}
- GET /applications/{id} (includes list of related configuration.ids)
- GET /applications

Configurations
- POST /configurations
- PUT /configurations/{id}
- GET /configurations/{id}

Persistence
- No ORM. Use raw SQL with:
- psycopg2.pool.ThreadedConnectionPool
- concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor
- contextlib.asynccontextmanager
- psycopg2.extras.RealDictCursor as cursor_factory
- pydantic_extra_types.ulid.ULID (via python-ulid>=2.0.0,<3.0.0) as primary key

Migrations
- A migrations table in the DB
- migrations/ folder with *.sql files
- migrations.py for migration logic
- migrations_test.py for testing migrations

Testing
- Every code file must have a corresponding unit test (*_test.py in the same folder).
- Focus on covering 80% of important scenarios.
- test/ folder should only exist if we need shared helpers/mocks/integration tests.

Dates and Times
- Use only APIs validated against latest Python docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html

Service Config
- .env for environment variables (DB config string, logging, etc.)
- Use pydantic-settings (>=2.0.0,<3.0.0) for parsing/validation

Developer Experience
- Use uv for dependency management, venv, and running scripts (no pip).
- Makefile with common targets (test, run, etc.), using uv run python -m ... syntax.
