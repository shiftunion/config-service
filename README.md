# Module 1 – Config Service + Admin UI

This repo contains a small Configuration API service and a companion Admin UI, built as a practice exercise to explore agentic/AI-assisted development workflows, iterative planning, and reflection.

## What’s Inside
- **`config-service/`**: FastAPI-based service with PostgreSQL persistence, raw SQL migrations, and tests. See `config-service/README.md` for setup, migrations, and commands.
- **`ui/`**: Vite + TypeScript Web Components admin interface with unit (Vitest) and e2e (Playwright) tests. See `ui/README.md` for usage and environment config.
- **`prompts/`**: Prompts, plans, and generated summaries used during agentic runs (e.g., endpoint summary).
- **`PART_1.md` / `PART_2.md`**: Step-by-step guides for scaffolding the service and the admin UI.
- **`JOURNAL.md`**: Run notes and reflections captured across iterations.
- **`INTEGRATE.md`**: Reflections on integrating learning with practice and agent collaboration.

## Why It Was Built
- **Practice agentic workflows**: Prompt → Plan → Implement → Test → Reflect, across backend and frontend.
- **Compare assistants/models**: Try different agents to scaffold, iterate, and test.
- **Capture process**: Keep prompts, plans, and reflections versioned alongside code.

## Get Started
- Backend: see `config-service/README.md` (Python, FastAPI, Postgres, uv, Makefile helpers).
- Frontend: see `ui/README.md` (Vite dev server, Vitest, Playwright, `VITE_API_BASE`).

## Key Docs
- Integrate learning and reflection: [INTEGRATE.md](INTEGRATE.md)
- Part 1 (Service): [PART_1.md](PART_1.md)
- Part 2 (Admin UI): [PART_2.md](PART_2.md)
- Journal: [JOURNAL.md](JOURNAL.md)

## AI Generation Notice
This README was fully generated by AI using the Codex CLI agent with an OpenAI model, based on the files currently in this repository.
